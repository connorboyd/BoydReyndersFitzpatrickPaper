Scala: The an outdated functional language.

Ever since it's inception, Scala has prided itself on being the only functional programming language [100% false] on the JVM.
However, Scala may soon become outdated with Java's new update, Java 8.
Java 8 uses what we call "Lambda expressions" to turn the imperative style of programming that is Java into a more functional style like Scala.
With the 2014 updates to the Java language, we may see a complete overtaking of the Scala language with the more widely used, and superior, Java implementations.

One of the features of Java 8 that exemplifies functional programming is its use of lambda expressions; these are typically used in GUI development.
GUI coding is important in connecting events to behaviors.
Events can be user actions, such as clicking the mouse or pressing a key.
The behavior is the action that follows the event.
An example of this can be seen using ActionListeners:

    class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener {
          public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                //do something
          }
    }

    class UIBuilder {
          public UIBuilder() {
                button.addActionListener(new ButtonHandler());
          }
    }

The ButtonHandler class implements an ActionListener, and stores one method, actionPerformed.
ButtonHandler has defined its APIs, declared by ActionListener. 
This code can be simplified with anonymous inner classes:

    class UIBuilder {
          public UIBuilder() {
                button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
                      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
                            //do something
                      }
                }
          }
    }

With anonymous inner classes, the new implementation is cleaner, but we still create an instance of a class for a single method.
Lambda expressions solve these kinds of problems.

A useful thing the Lambda expressions will be able to do in Java 8 is type inferencing. 
Type inferencing was initially introduced in the Java 7 sdk, but contribute to higher order functional programming. 
Type inferencing is very useful in programming because we can choose to omit a type definition whenever the compiler could infer that type by itself. 
For example, in this code:

    List<String> list = Arrays.asList(...);
    Collections.sort(list, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
     
we are able to name arbitrary new variables s1 and s2, but the compiler knows that we are talking about strings so is able to deal with it appropriately. 
The main advantage of Type Inferencing in java 8 is for syntactical sugar. The programmer is essentially limiting the amount needed to type out a function by using type inferencing.
