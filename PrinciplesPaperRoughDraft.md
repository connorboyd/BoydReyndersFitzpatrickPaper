Scala: The an outdated functional language.

Ever since it's inception, Scala has prided itself on being the only functional programming language [100% false] on the JVM.
However, Scala may soon become outdated with Java's new update, Java 8.
Java 8 uses what we call "Lambda expressions" to turn the imperative style of programming that is Java into a more functional style like Scala.
With the 2014 updates to the Java language, we may see a complete overtaking of the Scala language with the more widely used, and superior, Java implementations.

One of the features of Java 8 that exemplifies functional programming is its use of lambda expressions; these are typically used in GUI development. GUI coding 
is important in connecting events to behaviors. Events can be user actions, such as clicking the mouse or pressing a key. The behavior is the action that 
follows the event. An example of this can be seen using ActionListeners:

class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener {
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            //do something
      }
}

class UIBuilder {
      public UIBuilder() {
            button.addActionListener(new ButtonHandler());
      }
}

The ButtonHandler class implements an ActionListener, and stores one method, actionPerformed. ButtonHandler has defined its APIs, declared by ActionListener. 
This code can be simplified with anonymous inner classes:

class UIBuilder {
      public UIBuilder() {
            button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
                  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
                        //do something
                  }
            }
      }
}

With anonymous inner classes, the new implementation is cleaner, but we still create an instance of a class for a single method. Lambda expressions solve 
these kinds of problems.
