Scala: The an outdated functional language.

Ever since it's conception, Scala has prided itself on being the only functional programming language [false] on the JVM.
However, Scala may soon become outdated with Java's new update, Java 8.
Java 8 uses what we call "Lambda expressions" to turn the imperative style of programming that is Java into a more functional style like Scala.
With the 2014 updates to the Java language, we may see a complete overtaking of the Scala language with the more widely used, and superior, Java implementations.
