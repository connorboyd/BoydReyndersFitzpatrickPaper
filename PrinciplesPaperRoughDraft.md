Scala: The an outdated functional language.

Ever since it's conception, scala has prided itself on being the only functional programming language [false]
on the JVM. However, scala may soon become outdated with Java's new update, Java 8. Java 8 uses what
we call "Lambda expressions" to turn the imperative style of programming that is java into a more
functional style like scala. With the 2014 updates to the Java language, we may see a complete overtaking
of the scala language with the more widely used, and superior, java implementations.
